A weather tracking app where users can view the current weather and a 5 day forecast of the weather. The app makes api calls to the OpenWeather api for both the current weather and the UV index (uv index requires a separate call based on longitude and latitude). Users can search for any city in the world. 
Upcoming features: app will utilize the users current location for the first weather call. app will show a forecast. app will integrate the google places autocomplete. 

Technologies Used:
* jQuery
* ajax requests
* HTML5 canvas

# Early Work
A collection of web apps that I built to practice basic HTML, CSS, vanilla js, and jQuery when I first began developing websites
### Password Generator

Standard password generator I still use to generate my passwords! Users can choose the length and type of characters that will be used to construct their random password. This project was very exciting to me becuase I learned how to capture user input and modify the DOM accordingly. I also gained experience with CSS flexbox, pseudo-classes, and media queries.

Technologies Used:
* local storage
* Vanilla JS
