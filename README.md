# Small Projects

## Early Work
A collection of basic front-end websites that I used to practice basic HTML, CSS, vanilla js, and jQuery when I first began developing websites
#### Password Generator 
[View Code](https://github.com/elliotfouts/password-generator) | [Deployed Site](https://elliotfouts.github.io/password-generator/)

Standard password generator I still use to generate my passwords! Users can choose the length and type of characters that will be used to construct their random password. This project was very exciting to me becuase I learned how to capture user input and modify the DOM accordingly. I also gained experience with CSS flexbox, pseudo-classes, and media queries.
